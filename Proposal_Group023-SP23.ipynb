    "# Abstract \n",
    "We aim to build a model that predicts the price of Airbnbs in Europe using a data set from Kaggle which details the features and pricings of airbnb’s in various European countries and cities. This model would help people looking to travel quickly determine if an airbnb is fairly priced and the pricing trends of Airbnbs in general areas. The model would also help owners of Airbnbs determine prices according to their circumstances. The data used includes various statistics of airbnb features (e.g number of rooms, price, has superhost, etc). Utilizing a nested cross validation paradigm, we will be building a model that predicts the price of the airbnb. We will evaluate the model using appropriate loss functions that best suit the resulting model of our nested cross validation."

    "# Background\n",
    "\n",
    "Airbnb’s rapid growth over the last 15 years has turned the company into one of the three pillars of the short term rental market, joining traditional renting and the hospitality industry.There are over 5 million Airbnbs worldwide spanning 81,000 cities and 191 countries<a name=\"barron\"></a>[<sup>[1]</sup>](#barronnote). As Airbnb’s popularity first began to rise in the early 2010s, research on the company generally focused on its viability as a competitor in the short term rental sector and what effects the popular new accommodation sharing app would have on jobs and tourism in major cities<a name=\"Nguyen\"></a>[<sup>[4]</sup>](#Nguyennote). Findings correlated increases in the number of Airbnb listings with small decreases in hotel revenue and increases in traditional rent rates <a name=\"Kerren\"></a>[<sup>[2,4]</sup>](#Kerrennote). Due to the popularity of Airbnb as a product, more recent research has focused on exploring how Airbnb pricing can be used as an indicator for the health of the tourism and rental economies in cities<a name=\"Sans\"></a>[<sup>[6]</sup>](#Sansnote). Other research has compared differing spatial distributions of Airbnbs and hotels and how this difference changes crowd size and interaction between locals and tourists in cities<a name=\"Perez\"></a>[<sup>[3]</sup>](#Pereznote). Airbnb has a remarkable ability to capitalize on proximity to tourist attractions relative to hotels<a name=\"Gutierrez\"></a>[<sup>[5]</sup>](#Gutierreznote).This research also developed tools to chart where cities have seen the largest tourist pressure related to Airbnb growth<a name=\"Gutierrez\"></a>[<sup>[5]</sup>](#Gutierreznote). The project we intend to complete focuses on helping hosts and users of Airbnb determine fair pricing for lodging based on features of the homes or apartments.This service would help hosts ensure they aren’t undervaluing or overvaluing their services and give tourists the ability to evaluate whether pricing is fair when looking for an Airbnb to stay in."

    "# Problem Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "The problem that we are trying to solve is the difficulty airbnb users have when trying to rent an airbnb. More specifically, there are many factors when trying to figure out which airbnb to book in an area (e.g. policies enforced, how many rooms, reading reviews, etc.). This takes a lot of time and it is very rigorous to figure out whether or not the nightly rate of the airbnb is overpriced or not. Another problem is that airbnb owners may not know what to price their airbnb. They need to make sure the price is high enough but at the same time low enough that people will rent their airbnb. Simply put, the problem is the difficulty and time it takes to accurately value an airbnb. One ML-relevant solution is to use certain features of Airbnbs and use nested cross-validation to find the best model that would accurately predict the price of a given airbnb.This would allow airbnb owners and renters to get a good estimate of what they should pay or be paid for a specific airbnb. We can measure this problem by looking at the price an airbnb is valued at. This problem can be replicated as there are several Airbnbs in several cities/countries. "

    "Link to our dataset on kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/dipeshkhemani/airbnb-cleaned-europe-dataset?select=Aemf1.csv\n",
    "\n",
    "Our dataset initially has 40k observations, spanning 19 variables (columns): \n",
    "Name of the city, Price of Airbnb, If it is weekday or weekend, Room type, Type of Airbnb (e.g. Apartment, house etc.), Private Room, Shared Room,The Person Capacity of Airbnb, If the Airbnb host has Superhost or not, If the Airbnb has multiple rooms(2-4)rooms, Business (If the Business has more than 4 listings), Cleanliness Rating, Guest Satisfaction, Bedrooms, Distance to City Center (km), Metro Distance (km), Attraction, Normalised Attraction Restaurant, Normalised Restaurant index. \n",
    "These features and data may possibly change as we perform operations such as data cleaning. Each observation is a particular unit of input that belongs to a particular type of variable. Each of these variables have many data inputs, and each of these inputs is an observation. While all variables are important to consider in our dataset, some particularly critical variables are the city the airbnb is in, the price it has, whether it is a weekday or not, the guest satisfaction, and the amount of bedrooms. The categorical variables such as city and weekday or not will be one-hot encoded, and the rest of the data will remain in the numbers they came in. We will be performing one-hot encoding on some of the data, dropping some data that is unnecessary for our purposes of the testing, and perhaps re-naming some columns in order to be more efficient with our code.\n"

    "# Proposed Solution\n",
    "\n",
    "To help alleviate the uncertainty associated with picking and pricing airbnb’s, we propose a model to meaningfully predict price listings by leveraging features (e.g. location, day, number of people) from our dataset. By building a model that creates predictions of airbnb prices, effectively minimizing price while maximizing other desirable features, consumers can avoid spending long hours of deep research to find the prices that best fit their circumstances. Additionally, this model can minimize the research commitment of airbnb owners when setting prices according to the features strongly represented by their listing. We will use a nested cross validation of several machine learning algorithms for analyzing the impact of particular features on pricing and general trends in our dataset in order to pick the most optimal algorithm and hyperparameters for this model.

    "# Evaluation Metrics\n",
    "\n",
    "The model that gets chosen as a result of our cross validation will determine the error metric that we use to measure our models success and accuracy. One example of an error metric we might use, if a linear regression model is chosen, is the mean absolute error. We feel that the mean absolute error would be a good metric, especially relative to mean squared error, since the variance of price per night between the listings in our data set is large. Since there are many outliers in the housing market (e.g. penthouses, mansions,  beach houses) which can charge a hefty premium, we feel that the error which may occur when predicting these outlier will be greatly and overly exaggerated, thus using the mean absolute error will give a better representation of our model’s accuracy which will be more robust to outliers.

    "Our project does not raise any glaringly obvious ethical or privacy related concerns. Air bnb is a platform in the public domain and the data set we are using is from Kaggle, another open data set platform. Since we are not gathering any personal data on the individuals that own the properties in the data set or any other personally identifiable data (hosts are anonymous in this data set), informed consent is not needed for our project and is not a concern. Using the aforementioned methods to collect the data we are using for this project, we do not have any concerns about immoral data collection methods or any personally identifiable data being used which ensures privacy of the Airbnb host’s whose listings were collected in the data set. There is potential for bias when predicting the prices of air bnb in certain locations, due to historical policies in certain communities, which may have correlated to different prices than other similarly featured listings in different areas. If these historical policies play a factor in our models prediction we will make sure to eliminate these biases from our model and algorithms. Since this project will only be posted on a private github shared with the course staff there are no security concerns, beyond the regular ones shared by github and the course staff (e.g. hacking or glitch that could make the model public or leaked). One possible ethical concern is, if deployed into the real world, how the model could affect the housing and rental market. There is potential for the model to make the market in cities used for data more competitive and potentially expose overpriced air bnb’s. This could result in a loss of business for the hosts of these airbnb and by extension a reduction in income which could affect their standard of living. Beyond this scenario which could only be encountered if the model went into full production, we do not see any other concerns with our project. Overall our project has very few concerns, thus we have followed and considered all factors and guidelines to create an ethical model."
