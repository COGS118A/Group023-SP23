    "# Abstract \n",
    "We aim to build a model that predicts the price of Airbnbs in Europe using a data set from Kaggle which details the features and pricings of airbnbâ€™s in various European countries and cities. This model would help people looking to travel quickly determine if an airbnb is fairly priced and the pricing trends of Airbnbs in general areas. The model would also help owners of Airbnbs determine prices according to their circumstances. The data used includes various statistics of airbnb features (e.g number of rooms, price, has superhost, etc). Utilizing a nested cross validation paradigm, we will be building a model that predicts the price of the airbnb. We will evaluate the model using appropriate loss functions that best suit the resulting model of our nested cross validation."

So use the method that works for you, but do use inline citations.\n",

    "# Problem Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "The problem that we are trying to solve is the difficulty airbnb users have when trying to rent an airbnb. More specifically, there are many factors when trying to figure out which airbnb to book in an area (e.g. policies enforced, how many rooms, reading reviews, etc.). This takes a lot of time and it is very rigorous to figure out whether or not the nightly rate of the airbnb is overpriced or not. Another problem is that airbnb owners may not know what to price their airbnb. They need to make sure the price is high enough but at the same time low enough that people will rent their airbnb. Simply put, the problem is the difficulty and time it takes to accurately value an airbnb. One ML-relevant solution is to use certain features of Airbnbs and use nested cross-validation to find the best model that would accurately predict the price of a given airbnb.This would allow airbnb owners and renters to get a good estimate of what they should pay or be paid for a specific airbnb. We can measure this problem by looking at the price an airbnb is valued at. This problem can be replicated as there are several Airbnbs in several cities/countries."

    "Our dataset initially has 40k observations, spanning 19 variables (columns): Name of the city, Price of Airbnb, If it is weekday or weekend, Room type, Type of Airbnb (e.g. Apartment, house etc.), Private Room, Shared Room,The Person Capacity of Airbnb, If the Airbnb host has Superhost or not, If the Airbnb has multiple rooms(2-4)rooms, Business (If the Business has more than 4 listings), Cleanliness Rating, Guest Satisfaction, Bedrooms, Distance to City Center (km), Metro Distance (km), Attraction, Normalised Attraction Restaurant, Normalised Restaurant index. These features and data may possibly change as we perform operations such as data cleaning. Each observation is a particular unit of input that belongs to a particular type of variable. Each of these variables have many data inputs, and each of these inputs is an observation. While all variables are important to consider in our dataset, some particularly critical variables are the city the airbnb is in, the price it has, whether it is a weekday or not, the guest satisfaction, and the amount of bedrooms. The categorical variables such as city and weekday or not will be one-hot encoded, and the rest of the data will remain in the numbers they came in. We will be performing one-hot encoding on some of the data, dropping some data that is unnecessary for our purposes of the testing, and perhaps re-naming some columns in order to be more efficient with our code."
